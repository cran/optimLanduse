# 1 Introduction

This README is closely related to a publication in **Methods in Ecology
and Evolution** (Husmann et al. 2022). When managing ecosystems, the
question arises as to how to simultaneously combat biodiversity loss and
maintain ecosystem functioning while improving human welfare. Designing
multifunctional landscapes means deciding upon the composition and
configuration of land-cover types, given that landscape patterns drive
the landscape\`s ecological value and its ability to satisfy societal
demands. Land-cover allocation models, particularly optimization
approaches, have proven helpful in revealing trade-offs between multiple
objectives and services provided by different land-cover compositions.

The R package *optimLanduse* provides functions for easy and systematic
applications of the robust multiobjective land-cover composition
optimization approach of Knoke et al. (2016). It includes tools to
determine the land-cover composition that best balances the multiple
functions and services a landscape can provide, as well as tools for a
deeper understanding and visualization of the contributions of the
distinct indicators. The method has been developed and applied
previously in a couple of studies, with some examples to be found in the
[Literature](#6-literature) section. The methodological background of
the approach can, e.g., be found in Knoke et al. (2016) and Husmann et
al. (2022). We here refer to the nomenclature of Husmann et al. (2022).
The package opens the approach of Knoke et al. (2016) to the community
of landscape planners and provides opportunities for systematic or batch
applications. To further enhance this, we have designed a shiny
dashboard for the package to get a brief idea of its functionalities and
to facilitate the usage of the package, see
<http://rshiny.gwdg.de/apps/optimLanduse/>. The current package version
optimizes land-cover compositions, but aspects of configuration may be
added in the future.

# 2 Detailed Description of the Functions’ In- and Outputs

This chapter provides a brief overview of the package functions (Fig.
1). For detailed information on methodological background, functions,
and workflow please also refer to Husmann et al. (2022). We further
refer the reader to the respective help pages of the package for more
information.

The stable version of the package can be installed using the CRAN
server. The development version can be found on the GitHub project page.

``` r
# If not already installed

*Fig. 1: Overview of the functions of the* *optimLanduse* *package.
Green diamonds: input and output data; blue rectangles: functions; gray
parallelograms: optional function settings.*

## 2.1 Initialization and Input

The *initScenario()* function combines the user settings with the data
into an *optimLanduse*-object ready for solving. The following input
data are required:

- *coefTable*: The package is only capable of processing a long-oriented
  type of data structure (Table 1). All combinations of land-cover
  (landUse) alternatives and indicators must be listed vertically. Each
  row must contain the average expectation, the uncertainty, and the
  direction (more is better/ less is better) of the respective
  land-cover and indicator combination. The column names of the table
  must exactly follow the nomenclature displayed below. You can also
  find this format in the built-in example tables
  **exampleGosling.xlsx** or **exampleEmpty.xlsx**. The help files of
  the *exampleData()* and *initScenario()* functions contain more
  details regarding the required data format. An empty template
  incl. the predefined headings can be accessed via
  *exampleData(“exampleEmpty.xlsx”)*. All further columns in the
  coefTable will be dropped.

*Table 1: Example of the data set from Gosling et al. (2020) to
illustrate the required data structure.*

![](./man/figures/exampleGraphic.png)

- *uValue*: The argument for the uncertainty level
  (![f_u](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;f_u "f_u"),
  Equation 4 in Husmann et al., 2022). A higher uValue reflects a higher
  risk aversion of the decision maker. See the help file of the
  *initScenario()* function for more details.

- *optimisticRule*: Specifies whether the optimistic contributions of
  each indicator should be defined either directly by their average, or
  by their average plus their uncertainty (if more is better) or minus
  their uncertainty (if less is better). The former option is most
  frequently used in recent literature and therefore builds the default.

- *fixDistance*: Optional numeric value that defines distinct
  uncertainty levels for the calculation of the uncertainty space and
  the averaged distances of a certain land-cover composition (see
  Equation 9 in Husmann et al., n. d.). Passing NA disables fixDistance.
  The uncertainty space is then defined by the uValue.

## 2.2 Solver and List with results

The *solveScenario()* function takes the initialized
*optimLanduse*-object and only a few optional solver-specific arguments.

- *digitsPrecision*: Provides the only possibility for the user to
  influence the calculation time. As the solving process has no
  stochastic element, the calculation times depend almost only on the
  number of digits calculated only.

- *lowerBound* & *upperBound*: Optional bounds for the land-cover
  alternatives. The lower bound must be 0 or a vector with lower bounds
  in the dimension of the number of land-cover alternatives. The upper
  bound, respectively, must be 1 or a vector with upper bounds. Choosing
  0 and 1 (the defaults) as boundaries for all decision variables, means
  that no land-cover alternative is forced into the portfolio and that
  no land-cover alternative is assigned a maximum.

The returned *list with results* contains different information on the
optimization model. It first repeats the settings of the
*initScenario()*. These include:

- *scenarioSettings*: A data frame with the *uValue* and the
  *optimisticRule*.
- *scenarioTable*: A data frame with one row for each combination of
  worst-case and best-case outcomes of all indicators (thus the number
  of rows equals the number of scenarios
  ![N_S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;N_S "N_S")
  in Husmann et al., 2022). The columns contain relevant calculation
  steps for the optimization program. *adjSem\** are the uncertainty
  adjusted indicators
  (![R\_{liu}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;R_%7Bliu%7D "R_{liu}")
  in Husmann et al., 2022). *minAdjSem* are the minimum uncertainty
  adjusted indicators
  ![min(R\_{liu})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;min%28R_%7Bliu%7D%29 "min(R_{liu})")
  and
  ![max(R\_{liu})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;max%28R_%7Bliu%7D%29 "max(R_{liu})")
  the maximum uncertainty adjusted indicators. diffAdjSem are the range
  between these uncertainty adjusted indicators
  ![\delta\_{\text{min,max}\_{iu}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Cdelta_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmin%2Cmax%7D_%7Biu%7D%7D "\delta_{\text{min,max}_{iu}}").
- *coefObjective*: The optimization program is translated into a linear
  program with
  ![N_L](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;N_L "N_L")
  (number of land-cover options) coefficients for the inner solution.
  The inner solution is solved using the *lpSolveAPI()* function of the
  **lpSolveApi** package. *coefObjective* is the data frame that
  contains these coefficients.
- *coefConstraint*: A data frame with the respective constraints for the
  inner solution solved by *lpsolveAPI()*.
- *distance*: The distance of each scenario to its own theoretically
  best-achievable contribution (reference). See Equation 3 in Husmann et
  al. (2022).

This is followed by a summary of the results of the optimization:

- ![\beta](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Cbeta "\beta"):
  The maximum distance of the worst performing scenario (Equation 1 in
  Husmann et al., 2022).
- *landUse*: The resulting land-cover composition after the
  optimization.

## 2.3 Post-Processing

- *calcPerformance()*: Attaches the portfolio performances of all
  indicators and scenarios as a data frame to the soved *optimLanduse*
  object. The data can be used for straightforward visualization of the
  performance (e.g. Fig. 3). The performance is defined as the relative
  distance to the maximum achievable level for each indicator and
  uncertainty scenario. It calculates as 1 -
  ![d\_{iu}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;d_%7Biu%7D "d_{iu}")
  (Equation 8, Husmann et al., 2022)

# 3 Example Application

We here present the basic workflow on a literature example. The aim of
this chapter is to introduce the functionality of the packages’
functions and to explain the most relevant in- and outputs on the
example of a use-case in Eastern Panama. The data of this study can be
accessed in *Appendix A* of Gosling et al. (2020) and is also firmly
integrated into the *optimLanduse* package. The
*exampleData(“exampleGosling.xlsx”)* function helps loading the data in
the environment. The data integrated in the package already comes in the
required *optimLanduse* format, so that it can be used without any data
processing.

Enriching agricultural farms with agroforestry has been promoted as a
means to enhance ecosystem functioning in farms in Panama, while
maintaining important economic functions. Gosling et al. (2020)
therefore used the here presented optimization model to understand
smallholder farmer’s perceptions and values of agroforestry systems.
They identified 10 relevant indicators for a predefined set of
land-cover alternatives, which represent the farmer’s goals (such as
long and short-term income or labor demand, as well as carbon and water
regulation). A survey with local farmers provided the empirical basis in
the form of the farmer’s expectations on the indicator performance of
each land-cover (arithmetic mean) and its uncertainties (using the
standard error of the mean across the survey’s respondents).
Descriptions of the land-cover alternatives and indicators can be found
in Tables 1 and 2 in Gosling et al. (2020).

**Loading Required Packages and Importing the Data**

``` r
library(optimLanduse)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggsci)

# Loading the example data
path <- exampleData("exampleGosling.xlsx")
dat <- read_excel(path)
```

*dat* is in the required format. Refer to the help of the
*initScenario()* function or to the [Initialization and
Input](#21-initialization-and-input) chapter for more details.

**Initializing an *optimLanduse* Object**

``` r
# Initializing an optimLanduse-object
init <- initScenario(coefTable = dat,
                     uValue = 2,
                     optimisticRule = "expectation", 
                     # optimistic contribution of each indicator directly defined
                     # by their average 
                     fixDistance = NA) 
                     # 3 is the default
```

In line with Gosling et al. (2020), we chose the expected value of the
indicators as optimistic outcomes *(optimisticRule = “expectation”)* and
the same uncertainty level for the calculation of the averaged distances
and the uncertainty space (*fixDistance = NA*, see Equations 4 and 9 in
Husmann et al., 2022 for more details).

**Solving the Initialized *optimLanduse* Object**

``` r
# Solve the initialized optimLanduse object using the solveScenario() function                     
result <- solveScenario(x = init)

# Visualize the farm composition
result$landUse %>% gather(key = landCoverOption,
                          value = landCoverShare) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = landCoverShare*100, x="", fill = landCoverOption)) + 
   geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") + 
   theme_classic() +
   scale_fill_startrek() +
   xlab("Optimal land-use composition")+
   ylab( "Allocated share (%)") +
   theme(text = element_text(size = 14),
         legend.title=element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 100))
```

*Fig. 2: Composition of the optimized farm (based on data of Gosling et
al. (2020)), including all indicators. Each land-cover option is shown
in an allocated share (%).*

The resulting optimized farm composition (Fig. 2) corresponds to Fig. 3
(![f_u=2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;f_u%3D2 "f_u=2"))
in Gosling et al. (2020). It can be seen that the farm composition that
best contributes to all 10 indicators (i.e. the multifunctional
portfolio) is dominated by silvopasture and forest. According to Gosling
et al. (2020), this reveals the potential of agroforestry to serve as a
compromised solution to fulfill multiple ecological and economic
functions. Recently, however, the observed average farm portfolio of the
surveyed farms was mainly composed of pasture and cropland with only a
small share of forest (14%). This reveals that not all of the selected
objectives currently drive farmer’s land-cover decisions. The
optimization approach can then be used to dive deeper into the effect of
different goals on the resulting optimized land-cover composition and
the effects of uncertainty.

**Calculating the Portfolio Performances of the Optimized *optimLanduse*
Object**

``` r
# Performance calculations
performance <- calcPerformance(result)

performance$scenarioTable$performance <- performance$scenarioTable$performance * 100

ggplot(performance$scenarioTable,
       aes(x = indicator,
           y = performance,
           color = indicator)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept =
               min(performance$scenarioTable$performance),
             linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "",
                              nrow = 10)) +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position="right",
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = seq(1, 10)) +
  labs(y = "Min-max normalized indicator value (%)",
       x = "Indicators") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 101, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 101)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=100), size = 1) + 
  annotate(geom = "Text", x = 6, y = 100, label = "Maximum achievable indicator level",
           vjust = -1)
```

<img src="README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

*Fig. 3: The performances of each of the 10 indicators for the ideal
farm composition. The colored points are the achieved levels of the
indicators of all scenarios. The dotted, horizontal red line illustrates
the guaranteed performances*
![(1-\beta)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%281-%5Cbeta%29 "(1-\beta)")*,
and thus the robust feasible solution of the program (Equation 1 in
Husmann et al, 2022).*

Fig. 3 can be used to further explore the effects of the indicators on
the modeled land-cover decisions. Looking at the performances of this
multifunctional farm reveals which indicator equals
![\beta](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Cbeta "\beta")
and therefore defines the result (Equation 1 in Husmann et al., 2022).

Here, the worst performing scenarios of indicators 1 (financial
stability), 3 (investment costs) and 8 (meeting household needs) have
equally the largest distances. It can be seen that the portfolio appears
to be driven by these 3 indicators. In the worst-performing uncertainty
scenarios, these 3 indicators show the maximum distances across all
indicators. In other words, the guaranteed performance
![1-\beta](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;1-%5Cbeta "1-\beta")
of the portfolio is defined by these 3 indicators. A full list with
performances of all individual scenarios is provided by the output
*scenarioTable* after using the *calcPerformance()* function (Table 2).

It follows that these 3 indicators are crucial when discussing future
land-cover alternatives and concepts. According to Gosling et
al. (2020), this result is in line with current observed behavior since
the need for short-term liquidity mainly drives smallholder farmers’
decisions in the study region. Intermediate-term economic success is not
relevant until household consumption is secured. While the performances
of indicator 1 differ relatively strongly among the scenarios, the
performances of indicators 3 and 8 are quite similar within all
scenarios. This is attributed to the larger standard errors of this
indicator. Thus, it may be worth investigating the particular reasons
behind this high uncertainty for indicator 1.

*Fig. 4: The performance of each of the 10 indicators for the result of
the currently observed land-cover composition. The colored points are
the achieved levels of the indicators of all scenarios s. The dotted,
horizontal red line illustrates the guaranteed performance*
![(1-\beta)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%281-%5Cbeta%29 "(1-\beta)")*,
thus the robust feasible solution of the program (Equation 1 in Husmann
et al., 2022).*

Setting the arguments for the lower and upper bounds exactly to the
currently observed land-cover composition forces a solution that
corresponds to the current land-cover composition (Fig. 4). It allows
for the comparison and evaluation of the differences of the optimized
land-cover composition with the currently observed composition.
Comparing, e.g., the guaranteed performances
![1-\beta](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;1-%5Cbeta "1-\beta")
provides an objective measure of how an optimization enhances the
achievements of the overall performance. A deeper look at the
performances of the indicators reveals which indicators particularly
benefit from optimization. Due to the compromise nature of the approach,
indicators can also perform worse in the optimized portfolio when
compared to the current land-cover composition.

Amounting to 0.387, the guaranteed performance of the multifunctional
portfolio is considerably higher than the guaranteed performance of the
current land-cover composition (0.089). In the optimized portfolio, each
of the indicators considered is thus fulfilled by at least 38.7%
compared to its individual achievable level. The comparison of the
performances of the currently observed land-cover composition (Fig. 4)
with the performances of the multifunctional portfolio (Fig. 3) reveals
that, for example, the performance of the financial stability is
significantly higher in the optimized portfolio. The performance of
meeting households needs and liquidity, for example, decreases
significantly. The price to be paid for the best-possible compromise is
thus a fundamentally lower performance of both indicators that
approximate the immediate economic success. The generally desirable
multifunctional portfolio therefore does not promise immediate economic
success for the farmers.

*Fig. 5: Theoretically ideal farm compositions under increasing levels
of uncertainty.*

Solving the portfolio (Fig. 5) under increasing assumptions for the
uncertainty levels (uValue, respectively
![f_u](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;f_u "f_u")
in Equation 4 in Husmann et al., 2022) provides the sensitivity of the
land-cover compositions to an increasing risk aversion of the farmers.
Fig. 5 corresponds to Fig. 3 in Gosling et al. (2020). The higher the
uncertainty level, the higher the uncertainty spaces of the indicators.
Here, the composition of land-cover alternatives is relatively stable
across different uncertainty levels (Fig. 5). An uValue of 0 leads to
Portfolios without consideration of risk. Here, the results corresponds
to an ordinary (non-robust) reference point approach. Comparing
portfolios of uValue 0 with uValue 3, the share of forest decreases
slightly from 41.2% to 34.3% and silvopasture from 45.9% to 44.9%. The
share of crops decreases from 12.9% to 1%. At the same time, the shares
of pasture increased from 0% to 9.6% and that of plantation from 0% to
10.2%.

Alley cropping does not appear in any portfolio at any uncertainty
level. It does not, on average, contribute best to any indicator (Table
1 in Husmann et al., 2022). At least one other land-cover type
contributes better to each indicator. It also contributes the worst
(highest) to management complexity. This overall negative contribution
does not change with increasing uncertainty levels. By trend, higher
uncertainty levels lead to more diverse portfolios. The uncertainty
spaces of all indicators increase with increasing uncertainty levels.
These broadened individual uncertainty spaces then lead to a broader
state space with a higher number of possible candidates for
lowest-performing scenarios (i.e., scenarios that can under lower
uncertainty not become part of the solution, as their distances could
not be the maximum distance of any land-cover composition). Plantation,
for example, is not part of the portfolio till an uncertainty level of
1.5. Plantation only provides the best to the long-term income while
providing by far the worst to the general preferences. It also only
provides minor contributions to the indicators. Under an uncertainty
level of 1, for example, plantation provides the worst to the general
preferences even if all other indicators are considered as
worst-possible contributions. This ranking changes after uncertainty
levels of 1.5 and above. At uncertainty level of 1.5, the worst-possible
contribution of forests to the general preferences
(![1 - 0.99 \* 2 = -0.98](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;1%20-%200.99%20%2A%202%20%3D%20-0.98 "1 - 0.99 * 2 = -0.98"),
see Table 1 in Husmann et al., 2022) is then the worst possible
contributing indicator among all land-cover types.

## 4.2 Selecting Specific Indicator Bundles - Investigating the Indicator’s Sensitivities

The sensitivity of the land-cover compositions towards indicators or
groups of indicators can be analyzed by either excluding or adding
indicators and interpreting the differences in the results of the
distinct optimizations. To do so, individual and independent
optimizations are carried out in- and excluding different (sets of)
indicators. The set of indicators considered is representative of the
stakeholders’ preferences and perceptions. Comparison of optimal
land-cover compositions under differing indicator combinations may help
to understand how stakeholders’ preferences design the land-cover
compositions. The following code exemplifies optimizations for three
subsets of indicators presented in Gosling et al. (2020). The shiny app
of *optimLanduse* (<http://rshiny.gwdg.de/apps/optimLanduse/>) provides
straightforward functionality to define sets of indicators with a single
click. Further explanation and instructions are given in the app.

### 4.2.1 Socio-economic

*Fig. 6: Composition of the optimized farm (based on data of Gosling et
al., 2020), including only socio-economic indicators. Each land-cover
option is shown in an allocated share (%).*

The first example considers socio-economic indicators only (Fig. 6; see
also Fig. 5 of Gosling et al., 2020). The result corresponds to the
above shown multifunctional portfolio (Fig. 2). This is expected, as all
indicators relevant to the solution of the multifunctional portfolio
(financial stability, investment costs, and meeting household needs) are
also captured in the socio-economic bundle.

*Fig. 7: The performance of each of the socio-economic indicators. The
colored points are the achieved levels of the indicators of all
scenarios. The dotted, horizontal red line illustrates the guaranteed
performance*
![(1-\beta)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%281-%5Cbeta%29 "(1-\beta)")*,
and thus the robust feasible solution of the program (Equation 1 in
Husmann et al, 2022).*

An analysis of the performance of the socio-economic indicators shows
that the performances of the three relevant indicators equal the
multifunctional portfolio (Fig. 7). The result is still defined by
financial stability, investment costs and meeting household needs.
Consequently, the guaranteed performance
![(1-\beta)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%281-%5Cbeta%29 "(1-\beta)")
also equals the multifunctional portfolio. Therefore, this
socio-economic portfolio also does not perfectly reflect the currently
observed land-cover composition. This means that further indicators
appear to be relevant for the actual farmer’s decisions.

### 4.2.2 Ecological

*Fig. 8: Composition of the optimized farm (based on data of Gosling et
al., 2020), including only ecological indicators. Each land-cover option
is shown in an allocated share (%).*

As the second example, the ecological indicator group leads to a
land-cover portfolio comprising of only forests (Fig. 8; corresponds to
Fig. 5 of Gosling et al., 2020). It can be concluded that all
contributions of all other land-cover alternatives in all scenarios
(even the optimistic ones) to the ecological indicators are lower than
those of forests. The land-cover composition of the ecologic bundle
differs fundamentally from the currently observed portfolio. The
ecological indicators are therefore apparently not sufficient to
approximate the farmer’s current perceptions.

### 4.2.3 Immediate Economic Success

``` r
dat_short <- dat[dat$indicator %in% c("Meeting household needs",
                                      "Liquidity"),]

init_short<- initScenario(dat_short,
                          uValue = 2,
                          optimisticRule = "expectation", 
                          fixDistance = NA) 

result_short <- solveScenario(x = init_short)

result_short$landUse %>% gather(key = landCoverOption, value = landCoverShare, 1 : 6) %>%

*Fig. 9: Composition of the optimized farm (based on data of Gosling et
al., 2020), including the prospective relevant indicators of the farmers
only. Each land-cover option is shown in an allocated share (%).*

The third example is composed of a bundle of indicators that
prospectively reflect the farmer’s needs and perceptions (Fig. 9).
Corresponding to Fig. 5 of Gosling et al. (2020), this scenario only
consists of indicators that approximate immediate economic success.
Indeed, the land-cover composition of this portfolio best reflects the
portfolio observed in Eastern Panama. Hence, these indicators presumably
best reflect the farmer’s goals and perceptions in Eastern Panama. The
difference between this portfolio and the desired multifunctional
portfolio (Fig. 2) highlights the requirements a land-cover alternative
must fulfill to meet the farmer’s requirements and goals. The
silvopasture, as defined in Gosling et al. (2020), may not serve the
requirements of the farmers sufficiently. Since farmers rate liquidity
and meeting household needs higher than long-term profit and economic
stability, pasture outperforms silvopasture in the immediate return
scenario. Policies or development plans may consider these indicators as
key elements when promoting landscape development toward multifunctional
landscapes.

## 4.3 Pay-Off Matrix

A pay-off matrix provides information about the influence of single
indicators on the sensitivity of the results (see e.g. Aldea et al.,
2014, Table 1; Ezquerro et al., 2019, Table 1; Knoke et al., 2020,
Supporting Information Table S6). Originally, the pay-off matrix shows
to which degree all indicators are fulfilled on average when the
landscape is optimized for only one indicator. The average trade-offs
between the one (optimized) indicator and all other (non-optimized)
indicators are therewith shown. The fulfillment of these non-optimized
indicators reveals synergies or antagonisms between the indicators. A
robust pendant to this approach can be easily conducted with the
*optimLanduse* package as the degrees of fulfillment are delivered
straightaway using the *calcPerformance()* function.

In contrast to the original approach, each indicator has a set of
performances
(![U_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;U_i "U_i"),
Equations 2 and 3 in Husmann et al., 2022; Fig. 3 and 4 visualize the
sets of indicator performances). Following the robust philosophy, we
selected only the worst performance out of the set of uncertainties for
each indicator. The resulting worst performances of the non-optimized
indicators reveal the relative extent to which these indicators are
fulfilled under the worst-case uncertainty scenario. It therewith
reveals to which degree the indicators are antagonistic or synergistic.
The indicator performances are expressed in relation to the
best-possible fulfillment of the respective indicators (Equation 3 of
Husmann et al., 2022). In contrast to the original approach, we thus
calculate relative degrees of fulfillment for each indicator.

The following code calculates a pay-off matrix using the *apply*
function. For this, *payOffFun* encloses all calculation steps.
*payOffFun* expects the name of the indicator that is to be considered
in the optimization *x* and the data in the *optimLanduse* format *dat*.
In *payOffFun*, firstly (1), the land-cover composition is optimized
considering only the indicator defined in *x*. The resulting land-cover
composition is then (2) passed as lower and as upper bounds to the
land-cover optimization that considers all indicators. Accordingly, the
solution of the second optimization (2) is exactly the result of the
first optimization taking into account the indicator *x* only. The
second optimization only aims to prepare an *optimLanduse* object from
which the performances of all indicators can be calculated. It delivers
the performances of all indicators when only the indicator *x* is
considered in the optimization. From each indicator’s set of calculated
performances, only the minimum performance is selected (3) and then
saved into the pay-off matrix. To sum up, each row of the pay-off matrix
contains the minimum performances of all single indicators when the
land-cover composition is optimized considering only one indicator. The
name of this indicator considered in the optimization is written in the
first column of each row. The names of all indicators are given in the
table header. Consequently, the performances of the indicators
considered are obligatorily best fulfilled so that the matrix’s main
diagonal contains the highest value of each indicator.

``` r
# Initialize the optimization that considers all indicators outside of the
# apply function saves calculation time
init_payOff <- initScenario(coefTable = dat, 
                            uValue = 2,
                            optimisticRule = "expectation",

                                fixDistance = NA)
  
  result_filtered <- solveScenario(x = init_filtered)
  
  ## (2) Optimize the land-cover composition for all indicators, limited ##
  ##     to the land-cover composition calculated in step (1)            ##
  
  result_payOff <- solveScenario(x = init_payOff,
                          lowerBound = result_filtered$landUse,
                          upperBound = result_filtered$landUse)
  
  performance_payOff <- calcPerformance(x = result_payOff)
  
  ## (3) Taking the minimum performances of each indicator ##
  
  performance_payOff_min <- performance_payOff$scenarioTable %>%

It can be followed from the pay-off matrix (Table 3), that, e.g.,
liquidity and long-term income are fulfilled to high degrees when
optimized considering the general preferences only (row 2). In contrast,
farmer’s requirements regarding investment costs (0.012) and management
complexity (0.09) are fulfilled poorly.

When optimized considering only the water supply protection (row 10),
the indicators most relevant for the farmers (meeting household needs
and Liquidity, Fig. 9) perform very poorly (0.0). This shows that the
water supply function is clearly antagonistic to the farmer’s
requirements.

## 4.4 The Use of *fixDistance*

It can be advantageous to define distinct uncertainty levels for the
calculation of the distances to the maximum achievable level (the
reference)
![d\_{iu}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;d_%7Biu%7D "d_{iu}")
(Equation 3 in Husmann et al., 2022) and the actual distances under a
certain land-cover composition
![R\_{liu}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;R_%7Bliu%7D "R_{liu}")
(Equation 5 in Husmann et al., 2022, see also Equation 9). Too narrow
uncertainty spaces of
![R\_{liu}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;R_%7Bliu%7D "R_{liu}")
could restrict the state space of the distances too strictly. The
broader uncertainty spaces allow for higher freedom of
![R\_{liu}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;R_%7Bliu%7D "R_{liu}"),
which allows to cover more land-cover compositions. The distances are
thus allowed to be higher. This usually results in a more similar
composition of the land-cover composition with similar levels of
uncertainty. The transitions between the portfolios under rising
uncertainty values are smoother. The disadvantage of distinct
uncertainty spaces is that the distances can no longer be
straightforwardly interpreted. The distances calculated using different
uncertainty spaces considered in the denominator and the counter of
Equation 3 (Husmann et al., 2022) cannot be interpreted as a degree of
fulfillment anymore.

``` r
#### uValue 3 ####
path <- exampleData("exampleGosling.xlsx")
dat <- read_excel(path)

applyDf <- data.frame(u = seq(0, 3, .5))

applyFun <- function(x) {
  init <- initScenario(dat, uValue = x, optimisticRule = "expectation", fixDistance = 3)
  result <- solveScenario(x = init)
  return(c(result$beta, as.matrix(result$landUse)))
}

applyDf <- cbind(applyDf,
                 t(apply(applyDf, 1, applyFun)))

names(applyDf) <- c("u", "beta", names(result$landUse))

applyDf[, c(3 : 8)] <- applyDf[, c(3 : 8)] * 100

applyDf %>% gather(key = "land-cover option", value = "land-cover share", -u, -beta) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = `land-cover share`, x = u, fill = `land-cover option`)) + 
  geom_area(alpha = .8, color = "white") + theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Uncertainty level", y = "Allocated share (%)") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 100.01)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 3, 0.5),
                     limits = c(0, 3)) + 
  scale_fill_startrek() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "bottom")

*Fig. 10: Theoretically ideal farm compositions using the fixDistance
argument and increasing levels of uncertainty.*

It can be seen that the land-cover allocation transition under
increasing uncertainty levels (Fig. 10) differs slightly from the
multifunctional scenario shown above (Fig. 2). The here broadened state
space leads to a higher share of pasture under low uncertainty levels as
compared to the multifunctional portfolio above (Fig. 5).
